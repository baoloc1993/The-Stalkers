******************          PROJECT DESCRIPTION         ***************************
*	
*	This extension allows Facebook's users to search through a list of
* 	
*	thousands comments of a (single) post.
*	
*
*	The Facebook's users can retrieve the comment(s) by the author's name 
*
*	OR search for the comment(s) related to a keyword.

*	The current search function of Facebook doesn't allow searching in a single post.
